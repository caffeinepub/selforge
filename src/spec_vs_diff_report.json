  "summary": "HeaderMeasurements was updated to compute hasWeeklyData/hasMonthlyData, conditionally render Weekly/Monthly blocks only when data exists, and return null (collapse) when neither has data. This removes any \"No data yet\" fallback, but also hides the Weekly/Monthly labels when their respective data is missing (even if the other section has data), which conflicts with REQ-1/REQ-2 label-visibility acceptance criteria.",
