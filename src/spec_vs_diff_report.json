  "summary": "Diff implements web-search nutrition lookup via Google Custom Search (env-configured) with snippet parsing heuristics, adds a new nutritionSource='web-search' path in the nutrition fallback chain, improves meal prompt parsing to capture longer restaurant/menu item names, adjusts portion gram estimates for burger-like items, and updates Description results UI to display source badges. Diff also includes several broader UI/layout refactors and additional modules not explicitly requested.",
