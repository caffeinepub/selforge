# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the calendar widget and dashboard header more compact and cohesive, and apply a consistent stylish minimalist pass across the app while preserving the existing dark/neon aesthetic and functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Refine the existing LiveCalendarWidget to be noticeably smaller (reduced typography size, tighter spacing, less vertical padding) while keeping local time, live updates (≥1/sec), compact month grid, and current-day highlighting.
- Rework the Dashboard header (title + streak + calendar) into a single coherent minimalist header block with consistent alignment, spacing, and typographic hierarchy that matches the compact calendar.
- Apply a minimalist styling pass across Dashboard, Study, Gym, Nutrition, Goals, and BottomNav to standardize typography scale, spacing, borders, and card density while keeping the current dark/neon theme and preserving BottomNav behavior and active state.

**User-visible outcome:** The app looks more sleek and minimalist: the calendar is smaller but still readable and live-updating, the top header feels unified and clean, and all screens share a consistent compact dark/neon visual style.
